Detailed report on the experiment


Report created on 11-May-2022 22:03:01

====================================

The participants have been confronted with:
	2 time(s) with a unique bottle
	2 time(s) with a bottle twice
	3 time(s) with a bottle thrice

In particular:

	Bottle 1 appeared 3 time(s)
	Bottle 2 appeared 2 time(s)
	Bottle 3 appeared 2 time(s)
	Bottle 4 appeared 1 time(s)
	Bottle 5 appeared 3 time(s)
	Bottle 6 appeared 1 time(s)
	Bottle 7 appeared 0 time(s)
	Bottle 8 appeared 3 time(s)

The bottles decoded per round are as follows (Lb=label):

Lb	 R1	 R2	 R3
1	 2	 3	 7
2	 7	 2	 3
3	 1	 4	 2
4	 4	 7	 1
5	 3	 1	 4
6	 8	 6	 6
7	 5	 5	 8
8	 6	 8	 5

Removing the bottles that did not participate:

Lb	 R1	 R2	 R3
1	 2	 3	 NaN
2	 NaN	 2	 3
3	 1	 NaN	 NaN
4	 4	 NaN	 1
5	 NaN	 1	 NaN
6	 8	 NaN	 6
7	 5	 5	 8
8	 NaN	 8	 5

====================================
	Results per participant
====================================

	Participant: The subject

Guesses per round (Lb = label):

Lb	 R1	 R2	 R3
1	 1	 2	 0
2	 0	 1	 1
3	 2	 0	 0
4	 5	 0	 3
5	 0	 4	 0
6	 4	 0	 4
7	 3	 3	 2
8	 0	 5	 5

Matrix of correct guesses per round:

R1	 R2	 R3
0	 0	 0
0	 0	 0
0	 0	 0
0	 0	 0
0	 0	 0
0	 0	 0
0	 0	 0
0	 0	 1

Therefore, total number of correct guesses is: 1
which makes this participant XXXcompare vs randomXX

---Consistency

The following matrix with i rows, j columns, and elements (i,j) is interpreted as follows:
This participant guessed that bottle j was i precisely (i,j) times. 
NOTE: only values >1 are relevant for the consistency score.
    (evidently, the trace of this matrix equals the number of correct guesses.)

   1	 2	 3	 4	 5	 6	 7	 8
-----------------------------------------------------------
1 |0	 2	 1	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0
2 |1	 0	 1	 0	 0	 0	 0	 1
3 |1	 0	 0	 0	 2	 0	 0	 0
4 |1	 0	 0	 0	 0	 1	 0	 1
5 |0	 0	 0	 1	 1	 0	 0	 1
6 |0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0
7 |0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0
8 |0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0

The following matrix gives the number Np that a given bottle Bt participated,
as well as the number of times Ik that said bottle was invoked by the participant:

Bt	 Np	 Ik
1	 3	 3
2	 2	 3
3	 2	 3
4	 1	 3
5	 3	 3
6	 1	 0
7	 0	 0
8	 3	 0

Thus, the consistency score for this participant is: 0
