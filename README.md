This repository contains the codes that will be employed to process the data from the experiment to test McG's knowledge of wines. The associated preprint is under review. 
Note: the code data_process_MZ2022.m currently processes input from one participant only. This is sufficient at this stage of peer-review. Other features will be added closer to the experiment.
