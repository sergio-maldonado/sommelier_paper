# sommelier_paper
This repository contains the codes that were employed to aid and process the data from the experiment to test McG's knowledge of wines. The associated manuscript ("You must be bluffing, Mr Mc Garrigle: Challenging an amateur sommelier" by Maldonado and Zielinska) is currently under review.

The folder **experimental_data** contains the raw data (scans and digitised data) from the experiment, as well as the reports generated using the code **data_process_MZ2022.m**.
