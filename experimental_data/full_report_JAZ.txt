Detailed report on the experiment


Report created on 17-Jun-2022 20:22:37

====================================

The participants have been confronted with:
	2 time(s) with a unique bottle
	2 time(s) with a bottle twice
	3 time(s) with a bottle thrice

In particular:

	Bottle 1 appeared 2 time(s)
	Bottle 2 appeared 0 time(s)
	Bottle 3 appeared 3 time(s)
	Bottle 4 appeared 1 time(s)
	Bottle 5 appeared 3 time(s)
	Bottle 6 appeared 3 time(s)
	Bottle 7 appeared 2 time(s)
	Bottle 8 appeared 1 time(s)

The bottles decoded per round are as follows (Lb=label):

Lb	 R1	 R2	 R3
1	 4	 1	 3
2	 3	 3	 1
3	 2	 8	 2
4	 5	 6	 8
5	 6	 5	 7
6	 7	 7	 6
7	 8	 2	 5
8	 1	 4	 4

Removing the bottles that did not participate:

Lb	 R1	 R2	 R3
1	 NaN	 NaN	 3
2	 3	 3	 1
3	 NaN	 NaN	 NaN
4	 5	 6	 NaN
5	 6	 5	 7
6	 NaN	 7	 6
7	 8	 NaN	 5
8	 1	 4	 NaN

====================================
	Results for this participant
====================================

	Participant: JAZ

Guesses per round (Lb = label):

Lb	 R1	 R2	 R3
1	 0	 0	 5
2	 6	 7	 2
3	 0	 0	 0
4	 3	 5	 0
5	 4	 1	 3
6	 0	 3	 7
7	 5	 0	 4
8	 1	 6	 0

Matrix of correct guesses per round:

R1	 R2	 R3
0	 0	 0
0	 0	 0
0	 0	 0
0	 0	 0
0	 0	 0
0	 0	 0
0	 0	 0
1	 0	 0

Therefore, total number of correct guesses is: 1
which makes this participant XXXcompare vs randomXX

---Consistency

The following matrix with i rows, j columns, and elements (i,j) is interpreted as follows:
This participant guessed that bottle j was i precisely (i,j) times. 
NOTE: only values >1 are relevant for the consistency score.
    (evidently, the trace of this matrix equals the number of correct guesses.)

   1	 2	 3	 4	 5	 6	 7	 8
-----------------------------------------------------------
1 |1	 0	 0	 0	 1	 0	 0	 0
2 |1	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0
3 |0	 0	 0	 0	 1	 0	 2	 0
4 |0	 0	 0	 0	 1	 1	 0	 0
5 |0	 0	 1	 0	 0	 1	 0	 1
6 |0	 0	 1	 1	 0	 0	 0	 0
7 |0	 0	 1	 0	 0	 1	 0	 0
8 |0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0

The following matrix gives the number Np that a given bottle Bt participated,
as well as the number of times Ik that said bottle was invoked by the participant:

Bt	 Np	 Ik
1	 2	 2
2	 0	 1
3	 3	 3
4	 1	 2
5	 3	 3
6	 3	 2
7	 2	 2
8	 1	 0

Thus, the consistency score for this participant is: 0
